            <h2>(October 15, 1931 - July 27, 2015)</h2>
            <p>The complete name of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is Avul Pakir Jainulabudeen Abdul Kalam. He was born on 15
                October 1931 to Jainulabudeen, a Tamil Muslim boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameshwaram,
                Tamil Nadu. His family was poor and he had to do assorted jobs to supplement family's income. He
                completed his schooling from the Schwartz Matriculation School at Ramanathapuram. He then went on to
                attend the Saint Joseph's College at Tiruchirappalli. He completed his graduation in Physics in 1954 and
                then moved on to Madras to study aerospace engineering.After graduating from Madras Institute of
                Technology (MIT-Chennai) in 1960, Kalam joined Aeronautical Development Establishment of Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. In1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian
                Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of lndia's first indigenous
                Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near earth's
                orbit in July 1980. Joining ISRO was one of Kalam's biggest achievements in life. His research and
                educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the
                government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam played a major part
                in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni. Kalam served as the 11th President of
                India from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. During his term as President, he was affectionately known as
                the People's President.</p>
